## **Key Features**  
- **Postman Collection:**  
  - A complete set of Postman collections that test critical API endpoints of the Evershop platform, including authentication, product management, cart operations, and order processing.  
  - Organized tests that cover **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** HTTP methods.

- **Test Scripts and Validation:**  
  - Test scripts are used to validate API responses, status codes, headers, and data integrity.  
  - Includes tests for response time, API error handling, and edge cases.  

- **Environment Configuration:**  
  - Postman environments are configured for different stages (e.g., development, staging, production) to ensure testing is aligned with the correct API endpoints and credentials.

- **Test Automation and Reporting:**  
  - Automated tests can be run using Postmanâ€™s **Newman** CLI for integration with CI/CD pipelines.  
  - Detailed reports are generated after test execution, providing insights into test results and API health.
